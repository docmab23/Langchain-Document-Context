In 2022, total \\nrevenue grew 51% YoY to $81.5B and net income (GAAP) more than doubled \\nYoY to $12.6B.  \\nAs we progress into 2023, we know that there are questions about the near -\\nterm impact of an uncertain macroeconomic environment, and in particular, \\nwith rising interest rates.

In the near term we \\nare accelerating our cost reduction roadmap and driving towards higher \\nproduction rates, while staying focused on executing against the next phase of \\nour roadmap.  \\nOur ASPs4have generally been on a downward trajectory for many years. \\nImproving affordability is necessary to become a multi- million vehicle \\nproducer. While ASPs halved between 2017 and 2022, our operating margin \\nconsistently improved from approximately negative 14% to positive 17% in the \\nsame period. This margin expansion was achieved through introduction of \\nlower cost models, buildout of localized, more -efficient factories, vehicle cost \\nreduction and operating leverage. \\nIn any scenario, we are prepared for short -term uncertainty, while being \\nfocused on the long -term potential of autonomy, electrification and energy \\nsolutions.

Much of the profit in 2022 was driven by used cars and transactions in support of a growing Tesla fleet, such as part sales, paid supercharging and others.

Our non- GAAP financial measures include non- GAAP automotive \\ngross margin, non- GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders, non- GAAP net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders on a diluted per share basis (calculated using weighted average shares for \\nGAAP diluted net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders), Adjusted EBITDA, Adjusted EBITDA margin and free cash fl ow.These non -GAAP financial measures also facilitate management’s internal comparisons to \\nTesla’s historical performance as well as comparisons to the operating results of other companies. Management believes that i t is useful to supplement its GAAP financial statements with this non- GAAP information because \\nmanagement uses such information internally for its operating, budgeting and financial planning purposes. Management also bel ieves that presentation of the non- GAAP financial measures provides useful information to our \\ninvestors regarding our financial condition and results of operations, so that investors can see through the eyes of Tesla ma nagement regarding important financial metrics that Tesla uses to run the business and allowing \\ninvestors to better understand Tesla’s performance. Non -GAAP information is not prepared under a comprehensive set of accounting rules and therefore, should only be read in conjunction with financial information reported \\nunder U.S. GAAP when understanding Tesla’s operating performance. A reconciliation between GAAP and non- GAAP financial informati on is provided above.\\nFORWARD -LOOKING STATEMENTS\\nCertain statements in this update, including statements in the “Outlook” section; statements relating to the future developme nt,ramp, production capacity and output rates, supply chain, demand and market growth, cost, pricing \\nand profitability, deliveries, deployment, availability and other features and improvements and timing of existing and future Tesla products and technologies such as Model 3, Model Y, Model X, Model S, Cybertruck, Tesla Semi, \\nour next generation vehicle platform, our Autopilot, Full Self -Driving and other vehicle software and our energy storage and sol ar products; statements regarding operating margin, operating profits, spending and liquidity; and \\nstatements regarding expansion, improvements and/or ramp and related timing at the California Factory, Gigafactory Shanghai, Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg, Gigafactory Texas and Megapack factory are “forward -looking \\nstatements” that are subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward -looking statements are based on management’s current expectations, and as a result of certain risks and uncertainties, actual results may differ materially \\nfrom those projected. The following important factors, without limitation, could cause actual results to differ materially fr om those in the forward -looking statements: uncertainties in future macroeconomic and regulatory \\nconditions arising from the current global pandemic; the risk of delays in launching and manufacturing our products and features cost-effectively; our ability to grow our sales, delivery, installation, servicing and charging \\ncapabilities and effectively manage this growth; consumers’ demand for electric vehicles generally and our vehicles specifica lly; the ability of suppliers to deliver components according to schedules, prices, quality and volumes \\nacceptable to us, and our ability to manage such components effectively; any issues with lithium -ion cells or other components m anufactured at Gigafactory Nevada and Gigafactory Shanghai; our ability to ramp Gigafactory \\nShanghai, Gigafactory Berlin -Brandenburg and Gigafactory Texas in accordance with our plans; our ability to procure supply of ba ttery cells, including through our own manufacturing; risks relating to international expansion; any \\nfailures by Tesla products to perform as expected or if product recalls occur; the risk of product liability claims; competit ionin the automotive and energy product markets; our ability to maintain public credibility and confidence \\nin our long -term business prospects; our ability to manage risks relating to our various product financing programs; the status of government and economic incentives for electric vehicles and energy products; our ability to \\nattract, hire and retain key employees and qualified personnel and ramp our installation teams; our ability to maintain the s ecurity of our information and production and product systems; our compliance with various regulations \\nand laws applicable to our operations and products, which may evolve from time to time; risks relating to our indebtedness an d financing strategies; and adverse foreign exchange movements. More information on potential \\nfactors that could affect our financial results is included from time to time in our Securities and Exchange Commission filings and reports, including the risks identified under the section captioned “Risk Factors” in our quarterly \\nreport on Form 10 -Q filed with the SEC on October 24, 2022.
